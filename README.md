## Development

Initial development can be bootstrapped by running the following script

```sh
./start
```

This script will ensure that you have a postgres database set up, and will configure and
start all necessary services locally for a fully functional dev environment

## API Documentation

API documentation can be found by opening the following location in your web browser

```
file://<path-to-git-repo>/lulc-infra/api/doc/index.html
```

or ideally, once your development environment has been started, API documentation can be found
by navigating to

```
http://localhost:2000/docs
```
